### What I learned

I had a lot of fun completing this challenge! I was nervous about my ability to complete it, but I got most of the way myself which was very encouraging. I was glad to figure out using the svg image which always confuses me. I did get some great help on vertical alignment, box-sizing and best practices for sizing. Also, I can't quite explain it but something "clicked" for me about max-width doing this challenge!

### Continued development

Would love to keep working on utilizing svg images and best practices for responsive sizing.

### Useful resources

- [Vertical Alignment](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/css-grid-most-easy-center-vertical-and-horizontal/) - I looked at quite a few resources that outlined several different ways to do this, but Eric sending this helped so much! Highly recommend.
