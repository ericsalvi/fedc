## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (really got serious about this one.. should i have used a H2-H6 like the html validator is telling me?)
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow (I said i did this on a prior submission but i didnt really. this time i really did)

### What I learned

Grid! Had never used it before. This code is so simple and so satisfying. But the autoprefixer added some ugly stuff for compatibility that is making my vscode file red and it's bothering me but i have to just submit this and move on! I didn't organize my CSS as well as times past, and didn't use colors for variables, but I will get back into tha tnext time! Really had fun with this one. 

```css
        grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
        grid-auto-rows: auto;
```

### Continued development

I think I relied a bit too heavily on px padding which is not the most responsive or clean/efficient way to write CSS. I want to work more with min-heights and centering in the future.
