## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub Desktop

### What I learned

Was nice to get back to just CSS with no Javascript, lol. I did this alongside some Treehouse courses, and I learned about vw and vh which I liked using in this. I tried to use more relative sizing to make this super responsive. I also learned that float:right is frowned upon ðŸ˜© especially for what I was using it for, so I'm glad I changed it to position:fixed

Also, I fell in love with Live Server for VSCode on my first challenge, but it was fun to add more GitHub commits to this workflow. Probably did about ~40 commits total, after perfecting the change in Live Server.

### Continued development

I want to keep trying to use em, rem, vh, vw for responsive styling! I would like to get into more advanced CSS like Tailwind but I want to be really comfortable with something like this first, I'm almost there

I tried to use branching in GitHub but I got scared. Lol i still don't fully get it- i'm not sure if it makes sense to use branches for something this small. but i will try again next time!

- [Stefan Judis?](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/inset-is-a-shorthand-for-top-right-bottom-and-left/) - Loved this tip, glad Google lead me here
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - The tried and true. I will refer to this forever! Eric showed me it thank you Eric!
