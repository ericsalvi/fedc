## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

CSS Challenges + Solutions - i was proud to have figured all of these out myself!
- centering text with circle border radius background > added line height
- centering svg with circle border radius without cutting off > putting border radius on surrounding div, not the img element itself
- i wanted to make the submit button wider, but i wasn't sure whether it was better to use px or %. i went with %, because i think that's okay if it's relative to a div with a px width.
- i'm always thrown off by the colors for some reason. so i don't think mine match exactly. but i was proud that i figured out how to make the radial gradient start "at top"

JS Challenges - figured out the first one myself, second one had a lot of help from my TL Eric!
- submit button toggling display:none to display:block. Eric helped me even conceptualize what to do here, but i was proud of myself for finding a simple solution
- passing the rating variable through to the html. Eric helped much more with this one, and i wish i could have simplified his solution a bit like he suggested, but even understanding what he did to maintain the divs i had rather than making them a select, was a great learning experience. TYSM Eric!

### Continued development

More JavaScript!! I feel proud that I was able to handle the CSS myself this time, so I want to get through those CSS courses in Treehouse and make my way to JS!

### Useful resources

- Google.. hehe
