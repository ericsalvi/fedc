## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This tested my knowledge of vertical alignment and background image properties!

I also tried to not do any absolute sizing, instead doing all height and widths with padding in rem.

Also I forgot to validate my HTML before submitting but there were no problems. Phew. Also forgot autoprefixer, but added it post-submission. Though I can't really tell if it added anything this time.

### Continued development

Next challenge I want to try SCSS!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Background](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/) - I just love this site. What can I say. I trust them.
