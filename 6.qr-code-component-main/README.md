## My process

This was a speed run, and I'm pleased I got it done in <1 hour.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Sometimes using relative sizing isn't best! In this case, to keep it the same for mobile it was better to use px.

### Continued development

More challenges!
